# nvim

This repository contains my version of neovim configuration. 

It's based on configuration made by [Christian Chiarulli](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/nvim).
He did an excellent work explaining details about the configuration on his [blog](https://www.chrisatmachine.com/).
If you want to build your own nvim configuration I recommend his blog as a starting point. 

## Installation 

1. Backup your nvim configuration stored in `~/.config/nvim` folder. 
2. Clone this repository to the `~/.config` folder:

```
3. Run `install-dependencies.sh` script.
4. Start `nvim and run `:PlugInstall` command to install all plugins. 
5. Restart `nvim`.
